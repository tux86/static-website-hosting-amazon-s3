#  Static Website Hosting on AWS with Terraform

This project sets up a static website hosting on AWS using Terraform. The architecture leverages AWS Route 53, CloudFront, S3, Certificate Manager, and a CloudFront Function to provide a highly available, scalable, and secure solution.

- **Client**: End user accessing the website.
- **Route53**: AWS's Domain Name System (DNS) service that resolves DNS queries.
- **Certificate Manager (TLS Certificate)**: Manages SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS communication.
- **CloudFront Distribution**: Content Delivery Network (CDN) service for serving cached or original content from S3.
- **CloudFront OAC + S3 Bucket Policy**: Secures S3 bucket access to authorized CloudFront distributions using Origin Access Control (OAC).
- **CloudFront Function**: Handles HTTP redirects for domain consistency.
- **Private S3 Bucket**: Stores websiteâ€™s static assets with restricted direct public access.
- **Static Web Files**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files constituting the static website content.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:

- Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- Configure AWS CLI with appropriate credentials.

### Configuring Variables:

Before deploying the infrastructure, it's crucial to set up the necessary variables. Terraform utilizes variables to manage settings in a flexible manner. Follow the steps below to configure your variables:

**Creating a Variables File**:
- Create a file named `terraform.tfvars` in the project root.
- This file will hold the values for the variables defined in `variables.tf`.

```plaintext
# Example terraform.tfvars content

aws_region  = "us-west-2"
prefix      = "your-org-prefix"
domain_name = "yourdomain.com"
bucket_name = "website-name-frontend"
common_tags =  {
  ManagedBy = "Terraform"
  Org       = "My Organization name"
  Project   = "Static Website"
}
```
### Deploy to AWS:

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Generate an Execution Plan**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

3. **Apply the Configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

###  Cleanup

To destroy the provisioned infrastructure, use:

```sh
terraform destroy
```
